        <p>Photography is more than an art. It's a skill. Professional
        photographers take time to study and learn their art, learning exactly
        what is required to take an eye-catching photo. There are seven elements
        of photography that break down each of the things a true artist should
        focus on, and they are: <strong><em>line, shape, form, texture, pattern, color and
        space.</em></strong> Each brings its own unique quality to a picture.</p>

        <span><strong>Can You Teach Yourself Photography?</strong></span>
        <p>
          Photography is a hobby you can absolutely teach yourself. Trial and
          error and frequent practice will help you along as you get comfortable
          with concepts like exposure, aperture, shutter speed, and more. The
          first step is buying a camera and a few accessories to use as you grow
          your skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, photography isnâ€™t always an expensive
          hobby. You can learn the craft with whatever camera you have on you
          and without having to spend a dime. Of course, formal lessons come at
          a price, but there are many alternatives for you to learn photography
          and improve your skills without having to spend too much.
